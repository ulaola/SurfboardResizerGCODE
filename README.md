# Ula Ola Surfboard models
From: http://ulaola.site


## The models
Ula Ola surfboards are designed with BoardCad, edited in Rhinoceros3D and final GCode is generated with MeshCam.

All files of the design process models are in "modelFiles" Folder. 

## The Gcode resized software
This small python software that generates all the surfboard GCode sizes fron the original model Gcode.
The usage is very simple.



I wish you Enjoy it :)
